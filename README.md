## Used open weather app for the api

### This weather app allows you to search different regions of the world and get the temperature of that area. With a background that changes caused by the temp.
### In this app I used " open weather api " to search weather for any location. I also declared a function to return the date of the year. As well as changing the temperature from celsius to farenheit by using Math.Round{weather.main.temp * 1.8 + 32}.

## Search any city, country, or state to get the weather in that area!
